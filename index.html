      &emsp; My name is Alexander. I'm from Chicago, Illinois - born and raised. Just to clarify, I didn't go to West Virginia (but shout-out to West Virginia). I JUST finished  moving to Atlanta and am offically an Atlantean as of July 1st.
      <br> &emsp; I have a lot of different interests, but some of my favorites are:
   <ul>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Creative Writing</li>
    <li>Drawing</li>
    <li>Photography - I added a couple of old photos for fun (just click on the image)</li>
    <li>Boxing</li>
  </ul>
    </p>
    <p> &emsp; I come from a Data Analytics background, but am interested in Web Development, as well as, Design. I joined Digital Crafts to focus full-time on learning Front-End Web Development, and hope to get a role within a creative team. I look forward to meeting you all.</p>
